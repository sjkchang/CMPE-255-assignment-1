The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for this project are:

1. `Cell` class: This class will represent a single cell in the game grid. It will have properties for its current state (alive or dead) and its next state, and a method to calculate its next state based on the current states of its neighbors.

2. `Game` class: This class will represent the game itself. It will have a property for the game grid (a 2D array of `Cell` objects), and methods to initialize the grid with a random pattern of live and dead cells, update the grid for the next generation, and reset the grid.

3. `render` function: This function will update the visual representation of the game grid on the webpage.

4. Event listeners for the pause/unpause and reset buttons: These will pause/unpause the game and reset the game grid, respectively.

5. `server.js` file: This file will set up the Express.js server to serve the static HTML, JS, and CSS files.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

`server.js`
